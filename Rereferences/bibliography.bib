  abstract={Desde 2015, la Agenda 2030 ha incluido la igualdad de género como uno de los pilares para alcanzar el desarrollo sostenible. Tras el impacto de la pandemia por Covid-19, ha tomado mayor relevancia el abordaje de la crisis desde una perspectiva de género, así como la reducción de brechas entre mujeres y hombres. Para ello, se ha recomendado incluir dentro de los planes de recuperación la promoción de las mujeres en ocupaciones tradicionalmente masculinas. Esto implica promover su formación y capacitación en áreas del conocimiento relacionadas con las ciencias, la tecnología, la ingeniería y las matemáticas (STEM por sus siglas en inglés). Durante 2021, en Colombia 205.705 personas iniciaron una formación profesional en carreras STEM, lo cual equivale al 22,6\% de todas las personas matriculadas a primer semestre de un programa profesional. La masculinización de los programas STEM se evidencia desde el inicio de la formación: en 2021 el 31,5\% de las personas matriculadas en primer semestre fueron mujeres, mientras que el 68,5\% fueron hombres.},

  abstract={Business degrees are popular and lead to high earnings. Female business
  graduates, however, earn less than their male counterparts. These gender differences can
  be traced back to university, where women shy away from majors like finance that lead to
  high earnings. In this paper, we investigate how the gender composition of peers in business
  school affects women’s and men’s major choices and labor market outcomes. We find that
  women who are randomly assigned to teaching sections with more female peers become less
  likely to choose male-dominated majors like finance and more likely to choose female-
  dominated majors like marketing. After graduation, these women end up in jobs where their
  earnings grow more slowly. Men, on the other hand, become more likely to choose male-
  dominated majors and less likely to choose female-dominated majors when they had more
  female peers in business school. However, men’s labor market outcomes are not significantly
  affected. Taken together, our results show that studying with more female peers in business
  school increases gender segregation in educational choice and affects labor market outcomes.},

  author={Muriel Niederle and Lise Vesterlund},
  journal={Annual Review of Economics},
  year={2011},
  abstract={Laboratory studies have shown that women often respond less favorably to competition than men. Men are more eager to compete and their performance improves more with competition. This leads to fewer women entering and winning competitions. This review examines the robustness of these differences and the factors that contribute to them. Both laboratory and field studies confirm these findings, suggesting that gender differences in competitiveness stem from differences in overconfidence and attitudes toward competition. Risk aversion plays a smaller and less robust role. The article concludes by exploring ways to encourage both men and women to compete.},

  journal={ifo DICE Report},

  abstract={This paper examines the evidence for a gender gap in competitiveness, exploring its implications for labor market outcomes, education policies, and firm performance. The authors review a range of studies, including laboratory experiments, field data, and sports data, to assess the existence and potential causes of this gap. They find that women tend to shy away from competition, particularly in situations where they perceive a high risk of failure or where they lack confidence in their abilities. This difference in competitiveness can lead to disparities in educational choices, wage negotiations, and career paths. The authors also discuss the role of culture, socialization, and biological factors in shaping gender differences in competitiveness. They conclude that while the evidence for a gender gap in competitiveness is strong, it is not clear whether it is desirable to close this gap by making women more competitive. They argue that promoting a more balanced and inclusive approach to competition, where both men and women are encouraged to participate and succeed, may be more beneficial for society as a whole.},

  abstract={This paper presents experimental evidence suggesting that women may be less effective than men in competitive environments, even if they perform similarly in noncompetitive settings. The study uses a laboratory experiment with computerized mazes, finding that men's performance significantly increases in competitive environments (tournaments), while women's performance remains unchanged. This leads to a significant gender gap in tournament performance, absent in piece-rate conditions. The effect is stronger when women compete against men, suggesting that women may be capable of performing in competitive environments but are affected by the presence of men. The study explores potential explanations for this difference, including risk aversion, stereotype threat, and differences in effort costs and preferences.},

 abstract = {This paper studies the allocation of heterogeneous agents to levels of educational attainment. The goal is to understand the magnitudes and sources of mismatch in this assignment, both in theory and in the data. The paper presents evidence of substantial mismatch between ability and educational attainment across 21 OECD countries, with a focus on Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.  In the model, mismatch originates from: (i) taste shocks, (ii) binding borrowing constraints and (iii) noisy measures of ability in test scores. The model is estimated using a simulated method of moments approach.  The main finding is that measured mismatch arises largely from noise in test scores and does not reflect borrowing constraints. Differences in tastes for education across households play a minor role in explaining mismatch. Further, the estimation allows us to decompose the college wage premium, isolating cross-country differences in selection effects from the return to education.},

Unfortunately, past analyses of student achievement and educational production relationships have been plagued by both a lack of conceptual clarity and a number of potentially severe analytical problems. As a result, there is considerable confusion not only about what has been learned, but also about how such studies should be conducted and what can be learned.

Although boys and girls display similar levels of academic ability, boys choose substantially more prestigious academic tracks, where more prestigious tracks are more math- and science-intensive. Our experimental measure shows that boys are also substantially more competitive than girls. We find that competitiveness is strongly positively correlated with choosing more prestigious academic tracks even conditional on academic ability. Most important, we find that the gender difference in competitiveness accounts for a substantial portion (about 20\\%) of the gender difference in track choice. }",

Our results suggest that the two risk attitude measures are at best only weakly correlated. Only the questionnaire measure shows high test–retest stability, while virtually no such stability is found in the lottery-choice task. In addition, only the questionnaire measure shows the expected correlations with a Big Five personality measure and is correlated with actual risk-taking behavior. With respect to behavior in the trust game, we find a high retest stability of transfers. This supports the conjecture that trusting behavior has a component which itself is a stable individual characteristic.}

The framework, derived primarily from Bandura′s (1986) general social cognitive theory, emphasizes the means by which individuals exercise personal agency in the career development process, as well as extra-personal factors that enhance or constrain agency. In particular, we focus on self-efficacy, expected outcome, and goal mechanisms and how they may interrelate with other person (e.g., gender), contextual (e.g., support system), and experiential/learning factors. Twelve sets of propositions are offered to organize existing findings and guide future research on the theory. We also present a meta-analysis of relevant findings and suggest specific directions for future empirical and theory-extension activity.}

The specific context examined in the study is that of two pullout weekly enrichment gifted programs: one with single-sex classrooms, and the other with co-ed classes. The competitiveness of 129 students was examined in three different areas: motor (running), spatial, and verbal tasks. The results indicate that boys performed better than girls did in all tasks, with the exception of competitive verbal tasks. Girls were more competitive than boys were in verbal tasks, and there were no significant differences in competitiveness between girls in co-ed environments and girls in a single-sex environment.

Professors’ research output is used as a proxy for the quality of education at the university level. To allow for some degree of difficulties in learning English across countries, an English weight has been constructed. We found that disparities in English proficiency across countries no longer matter in academic publications. The research outputs in science and engineering appear to have a positive and significant effect on economic growth. Economics and business researches also have immediate growth effects, although these effects are a bit smaller. The results are, in general, consistent with the findings of Aghion et al.

This study examines how the earnings benefits of choosing a STEM major vary both by gender and across the distribution of academic achievement. I account for the selection into college major using propensity score matching. Measures of individual educational preferences based on Holland's theory of career and educational choice provide a unique way to control for college major selection. Findings indicate that the earnings benefit to STEM major choice ranges from 5 to 28 % depending both on academic achievement and on gender and that high-achieving students benefit more from STEM major choice. Further, high achieving men benefit more from STEM majors than high-achieving women. Earnings differences in major choice may play an important role in explaining the underrepresentation of women in STEM major fields, especially among high achieving students.},

We focus on estimation by local linear regression, which was shown to have attractive properties (Porter, J. 2003, "Estimation in the Regression Discontinuity Model" (unpublished, Department of Economics, University of Wisconsin, Madison)). We derive the asymptotically optimal bandwidth under squared error loss. This optimal bandwidth depends on unknown functionals of the distribution of the data and we propose simple and consistent estimators for these functionals to obtain a fully data-driven bandwidth algorithm. We show that this bandwidth estimator is optimal according to the criterion of Li (1987, "Asymptotic Optimality for C p , C L , Cross-validation and Generalized Cross-validation: Discrete Index Set", Annals of Statistics, 15, 958–975), although it is not unique in the sense that alternative consistent estimators for the unknown functionals would lead to bandwidth estimators with the same optimality properties. We illustrate the proposed bandwidth, and the sensitivity to the choices made in our algorithm, by applying the methods to a data set previously analysed by Lee (2008, "Randomized Experiments from Non-random Selection in U.S. House Elections", Journal of Econometrics, 142, 675–697) as well as by conducting a small simulation study.},

  abstract = 	 {Cross-entropy is a widely used loss function in applications. It coincides with the logistic loss applied to the outputs of a neural network, when the softmax is used. But, what guarantees can we rely on when using cross-entropy as a surrogate loss? We present a theoretical analysis of a broad family of loss functions, <em>comp-sum losses</em>, that includes cross-entropy (or logistic loss), generalized cross-entropy, the mean absolute error and other cross-entropy-like loss functions. We give the first $H$-consistency bounds for these loss functions. These are non-asymptotic guarantees that upper bound the zero-one loss estimation error in terms of the estimation error of a surrogate loss, for the specific hypothesis set $H$ used. We further show that our bounds are <em>tight</em>. These bounds depend on quantities called <em>minimizability gaps</em>. To make them more explicit, we give a specific analysis of these gaps for comp-sum losses. We also introduce a new family of loss functions, <em>smooth adversarial comp-sum losses</em>, that are derived from their comp-sum counterparts by adding in a related smooth term. We show that these loss functions are beneficial in the adversarial setting by proving that they admit $H$-consistency bounds. This leads to new adversarial robustness algorithms that consist of minimizing a regularized smooth adversarial comp-sum loss. While our main purpose is a theoretical analysis, we also present an extensive empirical analysis comparing comp-sum losses. We further report the results of a series of experiments demonstrating that our adversarial robustness algorithms outperform the current state-of-the-art, while also achieving a superior non-adversarial accuracy.}

We show that in settings with variation in treatment timing across units, the coefficient on a given lead or lag can be contaminated by effects from other periods, and apparent pretrends can arise solely from treatment effects heterogeneity. We propose an alternative estimator that is free of contamination, and illustrate the relative shortcomings of two-way fixed effects regressions with leads and lags through an empirical application.}

In particular, we review recent progress on survey measurement of expectations, information, and locus of decision of American families within the context of secondary schooling, and we discuss possible future developments by providing concrete examples from recent exploratory efforts. We argue that collection of data on adolescents' and parents' perceptions of the available school options and the application-and-admission rules, their subjective expectations about short- and long-term consequences of alternative choices, and their assessments of the locus of decision making within families could greatly enhance economic modeling and contribute to effective econometric analysis of schooling decisions.

abstract = {In this paper we use unique retrospective family background data from Wave 13 of the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) on different birth cohorts to analyze the relevance of family background, in particular parental education, and gender on differential educational achievement. We find parents' education attainments to be strong predictors of the education of their offspring. In particular, maternal education is the main determinant on the decision of whether stay-on beyond compulsory education. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a large set of control variables, including household income. A second research question addressed in the paper investigates whether the large expansion of the UK educational system during the last decades has concurred with enhanced relative educational opportunities for children of parents with low educational background. The analysis reveals that the relevance of parental education over time becomes stronger in terms of achieving higher educational levels, in particular university degree. However, there are significant dissimilarities with respect to gender differences; in particular we observe a positive secular trend in female education attainment associated to maternal education.},

Our estimation results show that single-sex schooling improves the performance of female students in mathematics. This positive effect is particularly large for female students with high ex-ante ability. An accompanying survey reveals that single-sex schooling also strengthens female students’ self-confidence and renders the self-assessment of their mathematics skills more level-headed.}

  abstract={There has long been a debate about the effect of coeducational settings on pupils’ academic achievement in schools. Exploiting quasi-experimental evidence from Colombia, this paper examines the effects of the conversion of single-sex to coeducational schools on students’ performance. Using a time-varying difference-in-differences strategy, we exploit the conversion of 95 male-only and 184 female-only schools to coeducational schools in a period of 20 years. The results suggest that males attending former male-only (ex-male) schools decreased their performance. In contrast, females attending former female-only (ex-female) schools increased achievement. Moreover, female students attending ex-male schools outperform females in coeducational, ex-female, and current female-only schools. Our findings support the hypothesis that a masculine schooling environment (i.e., on average, characterized as more competitive, and with a stronger math focus) may be beneficial for females’ performance, although this is to the expense of males’ achievement.},

We analyze longitudinal data from students who spent their academic careers in North Carolina public secondary schools and attended North Carolina public universities. Our results suggest that although the proportion of female math and science teachers at a school has no impact on male students, it has a powerful effect on female students’ likelihood of declaring and graduating with a STEM degree, and effects are largest for female students with the highest math skills. The estimates are robust to the inclusion of controls for students’ initial ability.}
